# Linear_Regresision_using_Gradient_Descent
 We will discuss about linear regression using gradient descent without using any machine learning library.
 In this repository based on the gold price data from years 1970 to 2000 we will try to predict the future price of gold. While doing that  we will understand the linear regression algorithm, gradient descent algorithm, importance of learning rate, error function and the math behind it.
 So open the jupyter notebook file Linear_regression_using_gradient_descent.ipynb and dive in.
